If proceedings are brought in Scotland or Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland, you may choose to have your contract and any dispute, claim or other matter of any description which arises between us governed by the law of Scotland/Northern Ireland/ the Republic of Ireland as applicable (but if you do not so choose, English law will apply). <br /><br />\r\n\r\nIdentity verification search: We will validate name, address and other personal information supplied by you during the order process against appropriate third party databases. By accepting these terms and conditions you consent to such checks being made. In performing these checks personal information provided by you may be disclosed to a registered Credit Reference Agency which may keep a record of that information. You can rest assured that this is done only to confirm your identity, that a credit check is not performed and that your credit rating will be unaffected. All information provided by you will be treated securely and strictly in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. <br /> <br />\r\n\r\n3. The cost of your break: Holiday Extras is committed to providing the best choice of product, at the best prices, so throughout the season we continually review our products and prices. There are likely to be some seasonal special offers and in some circumstances prices may go up or down. The price of your chosen package will be confirmed at the time of booking. <br /><br />\r\n\r\nWe reserve the right to correct errors in both advertised and confirmed prices. We will do so as soon as we become aware of the error. All prices are for pre-booking and include VAT at the current rate of 20%. <br /> <br />\r\n\r\n4. Changes by you: Should you wish to make any changes to your confirmed break, you must notify us as soon as possible. Whilst we will endeavour to assist, we cannot guarantee we will be able to meet any such requests. All amendments must be made through Holiday Extras. Any alteration requested within 24 hours of the date of ticket entrance to LEGOLAND or within 24 hours of the hotel stay will be treated as a cancellation by you and you will have to pay the cancellation charges set out in clause 6. <br /><br />\r\n\r\n5. Cancellation by you: Should you or any member of your party need to cancel your booking once it has been confirmed, the party leader must immediately advise us. All cancellations must be made through Holiday Extras and are subject to the conditions and charges (based on the total booking cost) below:\r\nWhen Cancelled &mdash; Cancellation Charge (% of total booking amount) On day of arrival - 100%<br /><br />\r\n\r\nWithin 1-3 days of arrival &mdash; 75%<br /><br />\r\n\r\nWithin 4-14 days of arrival &mdash; 50%<br /><br />\r\n\r\nMore than 14 days in advance of arrival &mdash; 25%<br /><br />\r\n\r\nCancellation on the date of purchase &mdash; 0% before 8pm &mdash; Unless your stay date is within 24 hours then 100% cancellation fees apply. <br /><br />\r\n\r\n[date from=\"2013-08-28 08:00:00\" to=\"2014-01-03 23:00:00\"]\r\n5.1 Winter Packages\r\n <br /> <br />\r\nIf you are staying on one of our Winter Packages, either a Winter Family Escape, Santa&#39;s Sleepover, New Years Eve package or a Big Build Weekend breaks, please note the standard terms and conditions do not apply.

Cancellation charges will apply if you cancel within 14 days of the event. <br /> <br />-->\r\n\r\nCancellation protection: If you add our non-refundable cancellation protection on to your booking (at the time of booking), this will protect you if you need to cancel for any reason. Provided you cancel your booking at least 36 hours before the date of your stay (or park entry whichever is the sooner), then the normal cancellation charge of up to 75% of the total of your booking will not apply. Please note that if you cancel your stay within this 36 hour period you will charged the full cost of your booking.  <br /> <br /> Cancellations must be performed over the telephone during our opening hours of 09.00 and 20.00. Cancellation requests via email or voicemail will not be processed. <!--When you book a Winter Break package excluding Bricksmas the 36 hour cut off period will not apply, but a 14 day notice period will need to be given before arrival.--> <br /> <br />\r\n\r\n6. Changes and cancellation by us: Occasionally, we have to make changes to and correct errors on web sites / brochures and other details both before and after bookings have been confirmed and cancel confirmed bookings and we must reserve the right to do so. Occasionally, we have to make a \"significant change\". \"Significant changes\" include the following changes when made before departure; <br /><br />\r\n\r\na change of accommodation to that of a lower official classification or standard<br /><br />\r\n\r\na change of accommodation area<br /><br />\r\n\r\nIf we have to make a significant change or cancel, we will tell you as soon as possible. If there is time to do so before departure, we will offer you the choice of the following options: <br /><br />\r\n\r\n(a) accepting the changed arrangements or<br /><br />\r\n\r\n(b) purchasing an alternative LEGOLAND&reg; break from us, of a similar standard to that originally booked if available. If the chosen alternative is less expensive than your original one, we will refund the difference but if it is more expensive, we will not ask you to pay any more. <br /><br />\r\n\r\n(c) cancelling or accepting the cancellation in which case you will receive a full and quick refund of all monies you have paid to us. Please note, the above options are not available where any change made is a minor one. <br /><br />\r\n\r\nIf we have to notify you of a significant change or cancel before departure, we will, as a minimum, where compensation is due pay you 20 per person depending on the compensation payments set out in the table below depending on the circumstances and when the significant change or cancellation is notified to you, subject to the following exceptions: <br /><br />\r\n\r\nCompensation will not be payable and no liability beyond offering the above mentioned choices can be accepted where we are forced to make a change or cancel as a result of unusual and unforeseeable circumstances beyond our control, the consequences of which we could not have avoided even with all due care. <br /><br />\r\n\r\nNo compensation will be payable and the above options will not be available if we cancel as a result of your failure to comply with any requirement of these booking conditions entitling us to cancel (such as paying on time)<br /><br />\r\n\r\nIn all cases, our liability for significant changes and cancellations is limited to offering you the above mentioned options and, where applicable, compensation. We regret we cannot pay any expenses, costs or losses incurred by you as a result of any change or cancellation.  <br /> <br />\r\n\r\n7. Force Majeure: Except where otherwise expressly stated in these booking conditions, we regret we cannot accept liability or pay any compensation where the performance or prompt performance of our contractual obligations is prevented or affected by or you otherwise suffer any damage or loss (as more fully described in clause 9 (1) below) as a result of \"force majeure\".<br /><br />\r\n\r\nIn these Booking Conditions, \"force majeure\" means any event which we or the supplier of the service(s) in question could not, even with all due care, foresee or avoid. Such events may include war or threat of war, riot, civil strife, terrorist activity or actual threatened terrorist activity, industrial dispute, natural or nuclear disaster, adverse weather conditions, fire and all similar events outside our control. <br /><br />\r\n\r\n8. Our Liability to you<br /><br />\r\n\r\n(1) We promise to make sure that the holiday arrangements we have agreed to make, perform or provide as applicable as part of our contract with you are made, performed or provided with reasonable skill and care. This means that, subject to these booking conditions, we will accept responsibility if, for example, you suffer death or personal injury or your contracted holiday arrangements are not provided as promised or prove deficient as a result of the failure of ourselves, our employees, agents or suppliers to use reasonable skill and care in making, performing or providing, as applicable, your contracted holiday arrangements. Please note it is your responsibility to show that reasonable skill and care has not been used if you wish to make a claim against us. In addition, we will only be responsible for what our employees, agents and suppliers do or do not do if they were at the time acting within the course of their employment (for employees) or carrying out work we had asked them to do (for agents and suppliers). <br /><br />\r\n\r\n(2) We will not be responsible for any injury, illness, death, loss (for example loss of enjoyment), damage, expense, cost or other sum or claim of any description whatsoever which results from any of the following: - - the act(s) and/or omission(s) of the person(s) affected or any member(s) of their party or - the act(s) and/or omission(s) of a third party not connected with the provision of your holiday and which were unforeseeable or unavoidable or\r\n- 'force majeure' as defined in clause 8. <br /><br />\r\n\r\n(3) Please note, we cannot accept responsibility for any services which do not form part of our contract. This includes, for example, any additional services or facilities which your hotel or any other supplier agrees to provide for you where the services or facilities are not advertised in our brochure and we have not agreed to arrange them. <br /><br />Also please note that whilst we endeavour to ensure photographs are appropriate and accurate representations they must not be regarded as contractual. <br /> <br />\r\n\r\n(4) The promises we make to you about the services we have agreed to provide or arrange as part of our contract will be used as the basis for deciding whether the services in question had been properly provided. <br /><br />\r\n\r\n(5) Please note, we cannot accept any liability for any damage, loss, expense or other sum(s) of any description (1) which on the basis of the information given to us by you concerning your booking prior to our accepting it, we could not have foreseen you would suffer or incur if we breached our contract with you or (2) which did not result from any breach of contract or other fault by ourselves or our employees or, where we are responsible for them, our suppliers. Additionally we cannot accept liability for any business losses. <br /><br />\r\n\r\n(6) You must provide ourselves and our insurers with all assistance we may reasonably require. You must also tell us and the supplier concerned about your claim or complaint as set out in clause 12 below. If asked to do so, you must transfer to us or our insurers any rights you have against the supplier or whoever else is responsible for your claim or complaint (if the person concerned is under 18, their parent or guardian must do so). You must also agree to cooperate fully with us and our insurers if we or our insurers want to enforce any rights which are transferred\".<br /><br />\r\n\r\n10. Complaints and problems: In the unlikely event that you have any reason to complain or experience any problems with your break whilst away, you must immediately inform the supplier of the service(s) in question. Any verbal notification must be put in writing and given to the supplier as soon as possible. If you are still dissatisfied, you must notify us at the earliest opportunity. Until we know about a problem or complaint, we cannot begin to resolve it. If you remain dissatisfied, however, you must write to our Customer Care Team within 28 days of the end of the break you have purchased from us giving your booking reference and full details of your complaint. For all complaints and claims which do not involve death, personal injury or illness, we regret we cannot accept liability if you fail to notify the complaint or claim entirely in accordance with this clause. <br /><br />\r\n\r\n11. Your Responsibilities: Bookings are accepted on the understanding that all persons travelling are normally in good health and able to fulfil the physical demands of a theme park break. <br /><br />\r\n\r\nIt is your responsibility to ensure all members of the party are in possession of all necessary travel and health documents before departure. British Citizens do not require a passport or visa for the Legoland Windsor Hotel Package we offer. Irish citizens require a full Irish passport to enter the UK. A full Irish passport takes at least 5 weeks to obtain. If you or any member of your party is not a British Citizen or passport holder and are travelling from outside the UK please check passport and visa requirements with the Embassy or Consulate of the UK and any other countries through which you are intending to travel. We cannot accept any liability or associated costs if you are refused entry onto any transport or into the UK as a result of failure to carry correct documentation. <br /><br />\r\n\r\n12. Conditions of suppliers: Many of the services which make up your break are provided by independent suppliers. Those suppliers provide these services in accordance with their own terms and conditions. Some of these terms and conditions may limit or exclude the supplier's liability to you. Copies of the relevant parts of these terms and conditions are available on request from the supplier concerned. <br /><br />\r\n\r\n13. Special requests and medical problems: If you have any special request, you must advise us at the time of booking. Although we will endeavour to pass any reasonable requests on to the relevant supplier, we regret we cannot guarantee any request will be met. Failure to meet any special request will not be a breach of contract on our part. Confirmation that a special request has been noted or passed on to the supplier or the inclusion of the special request on your confirmation invoice or any other documentation is not confirmation that the request will be met. Unless and until specifically confirmed, all special requests are subject to availability. <br /><br />\r\n\r\n14. If you or any member of your party has any medical problem or disability which may affect your break, please tell us before you confirm your booking. In any event, you must give us full details in writing at the time of booking. If we reasonably feel unable to properly accommodate the particular needs of the person concerned, we must reserve the right to decline their reservation or, if full details are not given at the time of booking, cancel when we become aware of these details. <br /><br />\r\n\r\n15. Financial security: For hotel packages with LEGOLAND&reg; Windsor entrance tickets, we operate a trust account. This arrangement means your money will be refunded in the unlikely event of our being unable to provide your break due to our insolvency.  <br /> <br />\r\n\r\n16. Call Monitoring and Recording: As part of our continuing effort to ensure you receive the highest service standards, we may monitor and record your call for training purposes. <br /><br />\r\n\r\n17. Directions: Please make sure you have directions to your hotel and the hotel's telephone number. LEGOLAND&reg; is well signed from the M4 and M3, basic directions are also provided on your email voucher. Directions should be used in conjunction with an up to date road map. <br /><br />\r\n\r\n18. Overnight parking: Parking for the night of your stay at the hotel is included in the price as and where indicated, otherwise a parking charge is payable directly to the hotel. Parking is always at the vehicle owners risk. Hotels own car parks are unsecured unless otherwise stated. <br /><br />\r\n\r\n19. Holiday Extras star ratings: All hotel star ratings in Holiday Extras literature are Holiday Extras own ratings and are based on the following: <br /><br />\r\n\r\nAny official rating awarded to the hotel, for example: AA Stars, RAC Stars and ETB Crowns will be considered, but they would not translate directly into the equivalent number of Holiday Extras stars. <br /><br />\r\n\r\nIf a hotel does not hold an official rating, we evaluate it on a similar basis to most official scheme operators. <br /><br />\r\n\r\nIn both of the above cases, when giving our rating we also consider: <br /><br />\r\n\r\nFeedback we have received from our customers. <br /><br />\r\n\r\nFeedback from our own regular visits to the hotels, both on business & as customers. <br /><br />\r\n\r\n20. LEGOLAND&reg; Brick Grading: Hotels within the LEGOLAND&reg; Holidays shortbreak program are provided with a brick grading. Brick grading reflects the suitability of selected hotels for family stays, including assessment of the availability of Leisure facilities, childrens entertainment and/or designated play areas, childrens menus, cots and high chairs. Full details of assessment criteria are available on request. <br /><br />\r\n\r\n21.

Alarm calls: As hotels do not take responsibility for alarm calls we suggest you take a travel alarm. <br /><br />\r\n\r\n25. Pre-authorisation at hotel: Please be aware that most hotels will ask you for a credit or debit card against which they can pre-authorise an amount in respect of any extras or other expenses charged to the room. The amount pre-authorised is at the discretion of the hotel and varies widely. In the event that any charges are payable you will be free to pay for these either with the pre-authorised card or by any other acceptable means.  <br /> <br />\r\n\r\n26.

It's also easily accessible by car.\r\n  <br /> <br />\r\n\r\n<strong>LEGOLAND Windsor Address</strong> <br />\r\nLEGOLAND Windsor Resort <br />\r\nWinkfield Road <br />\r\nWindsor <br />\r\nSL4 4AY <br /> <br />\r\n\r\n<strong>Traveling to LEGOLAND By Car</strong>\r\n<br />\r\nLEGOLAND&reg; Windsor is on the B3022 Windsor/Ascot road just two miles from Windsor town centre. Please follow all motorway local road signage. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nDependent on your direction of travel, please use one of the following routes:<br />\r\n<ul><li>M3 (Junction 3)</li>\r\n<li>M25 (Junction 13)</li>\r\n<li>M4 (Junction 6)</li></ul>\r\n<br /> <br />\r\n<strong> Please note that local road signage will get you to the Resort quicker!</strong> <br /> <br />\r\n\r\nTo save time on your way home we advise all guests in cars to turn right at the LEGOLAND roundabout and follow signs for the M25, M3 and M4. This route is faster as it avoids traffic congestion in Windsor.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nYou will need to purchase a parking ticket for £4. This can be purchased from the Ticket Booths or Guest Services at any time during your day. Car parking is included in the price of a Premium LEGOLAND Annual Pass or Premium MERLIN Annual Pass and therefore will not need to purchase a separate parking ticket. Parking is not included in the price of a Standard MERLIN Annual Pass.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<strong>Traveling to LEGOLAND By Rail</strong> <br />\r\nWindsor has two train stations. Windsor & Eton Central is the closest to Windsor town centre and your LEGOLAND shuttle. It is connected to Slough by rail.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nWindsor & Eton Riverside is a ten minute walk from Windsor & Eton Central and has many more mainline links including to Clapham Junction. <br /> <br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Distance From LEGOLAND To Other Merlin Theme Parks</strong> <br />\r\n\r\n<br /><strong>To THOPRE PARK by car</strong> <br />\r\nApproximately 11 miles, 30 minutes <br /> <br />\r\n\r\n<strong>To Chessington World of Adventures Resort by car</strong> <br />\r\nApproximately 30 miles, 50 minutes <br /> <br />\r\n\r\n<strong>Distance From Heathrow Airport to LEGOLAND Windsor by car</strong> <br />\r\nApproximately 13 miles, 30 minutes <br /> <br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>How to get to LEGOLAND from outside the UK</strong><br /><br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Getting to LEGOLAND by sea</strong><br />\r\nRegular crossings connect the Irish ports of Dublin and Rosslare to Holyhead and Pembroke Dock.

Once across the Irish Sea your ticket will allow you onward travel to Windsor.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<strong>Eurostar</strong>\r\nEurostar services run direct from Paris Gare du Nord, Lille, Calais Ville and Brussels Midi to London St. Pancras International. From St. Pancras it's possible to transfer across the London Underground and catch a train to Windsor & Eton Central via Slough from London Paddington. <em>Please check times, routes and changes before you travel.</em><br /><br />\r\n\r\n<strong>Getting to LEGOLAND from the airport</strong><br /><br />\r\n\r\nLEGOLAND Windsor is accessible from London Airports with Heathrow, Gatwick and Luton all under an hour's drive from the Park.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n<em>From Heathrow</em><br />\r\nIt takes roughly an hour to reach Windsor & Eton Central by train from Heathrow Airport.

Regular trains run direct to Clapham Junction or Farringdon.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom Clapham Junction: Change for connections to Windsor & Eton Riverside<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom Farringdon: Cross the London Underground to Paddington Station.
